Our motto is to automate the duration of life from entering a smart society to reaching your doorstep. So we built a prototype that recognizes you when you enter the building using RF id sensors (each resident has a RFID card). After identifying him, one of the lifts from the bank of elevators (whichever free) is assigned to come to ground floor. By the time the resident parks his car, the lift can start coming down and the resident will find it waiting for him when he reaches the elevator. Now, we have also made the lift interactive. A voice command "Hello El" will use a voice recognition algorithm to identify the user and will answer questions and accomplish tasks asked. The user can say "Turn the lights in my house" and the smart elevator will reply to it by saying "Okay. Switching on the lights. Welcome home!" and will do the same. This is how we are connecting smart elevators and smart homes. The interactions include other questions too, for example, regarding the latest news of the society (announcements), "How much time will it take for me to reach my destination?", etc.
All this makes life much easier.
